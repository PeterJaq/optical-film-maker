##  What is this Repo.?

This repo. is a tool box of optical film design based on machine learning. This repo. supports the numerical optimization of optical thin films by reinforcement learning at present. The optical material constant data is provided by [refractive index info](https://refractiveindex.info/). For the reinforcement learning module, we use [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) and [tensorflow-agents](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents) as our reinforcement learning research module. In the simulation part of optical film performance(such as absorption, refraction and transimission), we use a python implementation of Transfer Matrix Method from [Optical-Modeling](https://github.com/marcus-cmc/Optical-Modeling).
